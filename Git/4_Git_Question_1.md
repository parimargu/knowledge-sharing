# Git Question 1:

What is difference between "git push -u origin feature-1" and "git push"? Could you please explain me with examples?


This is a **very common question** for Git beginners — and it’s an important concept to understand clearly.

## ✅ Quick Answer:

| Command                        | What it does                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `git push -u origin feature-1` | Pushes branch to remote and sets upstream (tracks it) |
| `git push`                     | Pushes the current branch to its **upstream** branch  |

---

## 🔍 Let’s break it down:

### 💬 1. `git push -u origin feature-1`

This does **two things**:

1. **Pushes** your local branch `feature-1` to the remote `origin`
2. **Links ("tracks")** the local branch `feature-1` to the remote branch `origin/feature-1`

So next time, you can simply run `git push` or `git pull` without specifying the branch name.

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-1
# make changes and commit
git push -u origin feature-1
```

✅ This **initial push** tells Git:

> “Hey, I'm creating this `feature-1` branch and pushing it to the remote. In the future, please remember where to push/pull from.”

---

### 💬 2. `git push`

This **uses the upstream info** already configured.

Once you’ve done:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-1
```

You can now just run:

```bash
git push
```

And Git will **automatically push** to `origin/feature-1`.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

* `git push -u origin branch-name`:
  ➤ First time you send a letter to someone and save their address in your contact list.

* `git push`:
  ➤ Next time, you just write the letter and say “send to John” — the address is remembered!

---

## 🔄 Visual Example

```bash
# Create new branch and commit
git checkout -b feature-login
# Edit code, commit
git commit -m "Add login feature"

# First time push (sets upstream)
git push -u origin feature-login

# Later pushes (no need to specify branch)
git push

# You can also pull like this:
git pull  # Automatically pulls from origin/feature-login
```

---

## ⚠️ If You Just Use `git push` First Time

If the branch has never been pushed before and you just run:

```bash
git push
```

You’ll likely see this error:

```
fatal: The current branch feature-login has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use:

    git push --set-upstream origin feature-login
```

That’s why we use `-u` (short for `--set-upstream`) **on the first push**.

## ✅ Final Summary

| Command                          | Use When                       | What It Does                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `git push -u origin branch-name` | 🔰 First time pushing a branch | Pushes & sets upstream (tracking)   |
| `git push`                       | ✅ After upstream is set        | Pushes to the tracked remote branch |
