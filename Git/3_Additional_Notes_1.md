   <body><h1>Hello from GitHub Pages!</h1></body>
   </html>
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub.

Issues let you **track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or questions** in any project.

2. Click **New Issue**

   * Title: *Add login feature*
   * Description: *We need a login form with email & password.*
4. Assign labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, etc.

## 📊 3. GitHub Projects – Agile Boards Like Trello or Jira

GitHub Projects helps you manage tasks using a **kanban board** (To Do, In Progress, Done).

### 🚀 Steps:

1. Go to your repo → Click **"Projects"**
2. Create a project (e.g., "Sprint 1")
3. Add columns:

   * To Do
   * In Progress
   * Done
4. Link **Issues or Pull Requests** to the board
5. Drag cards across columns to track progress

This is great for team coordination, sprint planning, and productivity.

You can **collaborate privately** using GitHub Teams.

### 👥 How:

4. Set permissions:

   * Read (view only)
