Great! Let's take this step-by-step — I’ll now guide you through:

---

## ✅ Real-World GitHub Collaboration Demo (Live Example)

We'll do the following:

1. 📦 Fork a public repo
2. 🔁 Clone it locally
3. 🌿 Create a feature branch
4. ✍️ Make changes, commit, and push
5. 🤝 Create a Pull Request
6. ⚔️ (Optional) Learn how to handle merge conflicts

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Fork a Public Repository

**Forking** creates **your own copy** of someone else’s GitHub repo, so you can contribute.

1. Go to this demo repo:
   🔗 [https://github.com/DataMaking/hello-git-collab](https://github.com/DataMaking/hello-git-collab)

2. Click **Fork** (top-right corner)
   This creates a copy in your account:
   `https://github.com/your-username/hello-git-collab`

---

## 💻 Step 2: Clone the Forked Repo

On your forked repo page, click **Code → HTTPS → Copy** the URL.

Then open terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-git-collab.git
cd hello-git-collab
```

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b add-my-info
```

---

## ✍️ Step 4: Make a Change

Edit the file named `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and add your name like this:

```md
- Your Name – your.github.username
```

Then commit the change:

```bash
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
git commit -m "Add my name to contributors list"
```

Push it to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin add-my-info
```

---

## 🤝 Step 5: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your repo on GitHub.
2. GitHub will prompt: **"Compare & pull request"** → click it.
3. Add a title like “Add my name to contributors”
4. Click **Create pull request**

✅ That’s it! The repository owner (in this case, me) can now **review and merge** your contribution.

---

## ⚠️ (Optional) Step 6: Handle Merge Conflicts

> Merge conflicts happen when two branches change the same line of a file.

Example:

* You and someone else both edit line 5 of `README.md`.

### How to resolve:

1. Git will mark conflict areas like:

   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Other person's changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```

2. You must **manually edit** the file to keep the right content.

3. Then:

   ```bash
   git add filename
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
   git push
   ```
