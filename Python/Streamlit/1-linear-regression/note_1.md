### Explanation of `remove_pps_outliers` Function

This function is designed to **remove outlier properties** from a real estate dataset based on the **price per square foot (PPS)** for each location. Here's a breakdown:

---

#### 1. **Why is this needed?**
   - Real estate prices vary significantly by location (e.g., city center vs. suburbs).
   - Some properties might have **abnormally high/low prices per sqft** due to:
     - Data entry errors (e.g., missing a zero in `total_sqft` or `price`).
     - Unique properties (e.g., heritage homes, distressed sales).
   - These outliers can **distort analysis/models** (e.g., predicting prices).

---

#### 2. **How it works**
   - **Group by Location**:  
     Properties are grouped by their `location` (e.g., "Whitefield", "Electronic City").
     ```python
     for key, subdf in df.groupby('location'):
     ```

   - **Calculate Mean & Standard Deviation**:  
     For each location, compute:
     - `m` = Average PPS (`np.mean`)
     - `st` = Standard Deviation of PPS (`np.std`)
     ```python
     m = np.mean(subdf.price_per_sqft)
     st = np.std(subdf.price_per_sqft)
     ```

   - **Filter Outliers**:  
     Keep properties where PPS is within **1 standard deviation** of the mean:  
     `(m - st) < PPS < (m + st)`  
     This retains ~68% of data (assuming normal distribution). [Normal Distribution](https://medium.com/@roshmitadey/normal-distribution-and-its-significance-10fea108588c)

    
     ```python
     reduced_df = subdf[(subdf.price_per_sqft > (m - st)) & 
                       (subdf.price_per_sqft < (m + st))]
     ```

   - **Combine Results**:  
     Merge filtered data from all locations into a new DataFrame:
     ```python
     df_out = pd.concat([df_out, reduced_df], ignore_index=True)
     ```

#### 3. **Key Concepts**
   - **Price per Sqft (PPS)**:  
     `price_per_sqft = (price * 1,000,000) / total_sqft`  
     (Converts `price` in ₹ lakhs to ₹/sqft).
   - **Standard Deviation (`st`)**:  
     Measures how "spread out" PPS values are in a location. A high `st` means prices vary widely.
   - **Outlier Removal**:  
     Properties with PPS far from the average (beyond `±st`) are discarded.

#### 4. **Example**
   - **Location**: "Whitefield"
   - **Mean PPS (`m`)**: ₹5,000/sqft
   - **Std Dev (`st`)**: ₹500/sqft
   - **Valid Range**: ₹4,500 – ₹5,500/sqft  
   - **Result**: A property in Whitefield priced at ₹10,000/sqft is removed.

---

#### 5. **After Execution**
   - `df` now contains only properties with "typical" PPS for their location.
   - `df.shape` shows the reduced dataset size (rows, columns).

This ensures the dataset is **cleaner and more representative** of real-world prices. 🏠📊
