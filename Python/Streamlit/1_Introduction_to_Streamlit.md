### 📌 When to Use Python Streamlit?

You should consider using **Streamlit** when:

| Scenario                                                              | Why Streamlit?                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ You want to **visualize data** quickly                              | Use `st.line_chart()`, `st.map()`, etc.            |
| ✅ You have an **ML model** and want to **create a web app** around it | One file + Python = working app                    |
| ✅ You're a data scientist and don’t know frontend technologies        | No HTML/JS/CSS required                            |
| ✅ You want to build a **real-time interactive interface**             | Easy with widgets (`st.button`, `st.slider`, etc.) |
| ✅ You want to share results or reports with others                    | Host online with one command (`streamlit share`)   |
