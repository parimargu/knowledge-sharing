## 🧠 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that allows computers to **learn from data** and **make decisions or predictions** **without being explicitly programmed**.

---

### 📘 Machine Learning Definition:

> **Machine Learning** is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn and improve from experience automatically, using data, without being explicitly programmed.

— *Arthur Samuel, pioneer in AI and ML*

### 📊 Example to Understand:

Let’s say you want to teach a computer to **predict house prices** based on:

* Number of bedrooms
* Area in square feet
* Location

You **feed it past data** (with known prices), and the computer **learns patterns**. Once trained, it can **predict the price** of a new house even if it has never seen that specific one before.

---

### 🔍 In Simple Terms:

> Machine Learning = Learning from **examples/data** + Making **smart predictions** or **decisions**.

## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is mainly divided into **three types**, based on the kind of **task** and **feedback**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Supervised Learning**

> The model learns using **labeled data** (data with input and known output).

#### 📌 Example:

* You give data like:

  * `Area: 1200 sqft, Bedrooms: 2 → Price: ₹50 Lakhs`
  * `Area: 1500 sqft, Bedrooms: 3 → Price: ₹70 Lakhs`

* The model **learns the relationship** between inputs and outputs to **predict** the price of a new house.

#### 🧠 Common Algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* Spam email detection
* House price prediction
* Disease diagnosis

---

### 2️⃣ **Unsupervised Learning**

> The model learns from **unlabeled data** – only inputs, no outputs.

#### 📌 Example:

* You give customer shopping data without labels.
* The model groups customers into **clusters** based on behavior (like age, purchase patterns).

#### 🧠 Common Algorithms:

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* DBSCAN

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* Customer segmentation
* Market basket analysis
* Anomaly detection

---

### 3️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning**

> The model **learns by trial and error**, receiving **rewards or penalties** for actions.

#### 📌 Example:

* A robot learns to walk by trying different movements and getting rewarded when it moves correctly.

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* Agent, Environment, Actions, Rewards
* Q-Learning
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* Self-driving cars
* Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, Chess)
* Robotics
